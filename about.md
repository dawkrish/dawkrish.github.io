I am Krishnansh Agarwal, a student at IITM BS [(Online)](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/academics.html) in Data Science and Programming.

I am a passionate student developer.
I like building web apps and cli tools.

My favourite topic currently is programming languages.
That said, here are my favourite languages:

- Haskell
- Golang
- Python

I soon want to learn a lisp. I will read the [SICP](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) book, start with Scheme and then move to Clojure/Racket.
